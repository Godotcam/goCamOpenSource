			<p><strong>3. AGE-VERIFICATION METHODS.</strong></p>

			<p>3.1 The End User does not need an account in GO.CAM and can use GO.CAM without creating an account before proceeding with Age Verification, provided that the End User is referred to the Age Verification by one of our Business Customers. </p>

			<p>3.2 GO.CAM will carry out the Age Verification as follows: </p>

			<p>(1) First GO.CAM shall execute the Age-Verification by way of face recognition whereby you have to take a selfie of yourself. We will make  several snapshots of your face in a mixed combination of smiling/non-smiling poses, in order to verify that there is actually a live person in front of the camera.</p>

			<p>(2) If the age we detected at the first step doesn’t satisfy the age of majority, we will execute the Age-Verification by way of identification of a provided government issued identification form. In this respect we ask you to provide a valid form of identification (ID card, driver license, passport) from which we will extract the relevant information we need in order to decide if you have the proper age to access the Website Services provided by our Business Customer. GO.CAM shall use/extract the data from the End User who chooses any of these: (i) ID card; (ii) driving license; and/or (iii) passport. </p>

			<p>3.3 Absolutely no data are transferred between you/your device and GO.CAM’s servers. All the process takes place in your browser, on your device, without any piece of information being exchanged with us. In case of identification of a provided government issued identification form, the End User Data provided on GO.CAM consisting of a scanned copy / photo of the ID card, passport or driving license of the End User, will reside only on the End User’s device (PC/laptop/smartphone) and will be processed live without being stored on GO.CAM’s servers or network. All the communication between your device and the servers where GO.CAM application is hosted, is encrypted using  a 2048-bit SSL certificate.</p>

			<p>3.4 After the Age-Verification, we will only receive an answer stating either that your age is not less than 18 years old or that your age is less than 18 years old. We will use that answer to let the Business Customer know if he can provide/render the Website Services to You. </p>

			<p>3.5 The Age-Verification Data used in the Age-Verification Methods used by GO.CAM cannot be reasonably known by another person other than the End User, without theft of fraudulent use of data or identification documents nor readily obtained or used by another person. </p>
